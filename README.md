# Real World Population Data Analysis and Visualization

This project involves data analysis on a real-world population dataset containing populations of 150+ countries from 1950 to 2021. The purpose of this analysis is to write several functions that take country names as arguments and visualize their population trends for specific age groups.

## Features

- **Plot Annual Time Series for a Country:**  
  The first function takes the name of a country as an argument and plots its annual population time series.

- **Compare Multiple Countries:**  
  The second function takes a list of countries and plots their time series, allowing comparison of mutual trends.

- **Stacked Bar Chart for Age Groups:**  
  The third function generates a stacked bar chart for three particular age groups of any selected country.

- **Percentage of Age Groups in Stacked Bar Chart:**  
  The fourth function visualizes the percentage distribution of three age groups for a selected country using a stacked bar chart.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **Pandas**
- **Matplotlib**

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the analysis scripts to visualize the population data as described above.
