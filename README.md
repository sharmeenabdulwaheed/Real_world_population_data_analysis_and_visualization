# Real_world_population_data_analysis_and_visualization
This is the data analysis that I performed on a real world population dataset containing populations of 150+ countries from 1950 to 2021. The requirement of this analysis was to write few functions that will take the country name as argument and visualize its population trends for specific age groups.
1st Function take name of country as argument and plot its annual time series. 2nd function will take the list of countries and plot their time series showing mutual trends. 3rd function will plot stack bar chart for three particular age groups of any selected country. 4th function will plot percentage of three age groups in a stacked bar chart.
